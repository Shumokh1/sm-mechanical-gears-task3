## Overview

Task3: Design a gear train with four gears to achieve an overall gear ratio of 18:1.

The goal of this task is to achieve a specific overall gear ratio by carefully selecting the number of teeth for each gear.


## Example of Gear Train with ratio of 18/1

To achieve an overall gear ratio of 18:1, one possible set of teeth counts for the gears is:

- **Gear 1:** 5 teeth
- **Gear 2:** 30 teeth
- **Gear 3:** 10 teeth
- **Gear 4:** 30 teeth


## Explanation 

- **Gear1 with 5 teeth will rotate 6 times to complete one full rotation of Gear2 with 30 teeth.**
  - This is because Gear2 has 6 times more teeth than Gear1, so Gear1 needs to rotate 6 times to turn Gear2 once.

- **Gear3 with 10 teeth will rotate 3 times to complete one full rotation of Gear4 with 30 teeth.**
  - This is because Gear4 has 3 times more teeth than Gear3, so Gear3 needs to rotate 3 times to turn Gear4 once.

- **Combining these two ratios, the overall gear ratio from Gear1 to Gear4 is 6 times 3, which equals 18/1**
  - This means that for Gear1 to turn Gear4 once, Gear1 must rotate 18 times.
